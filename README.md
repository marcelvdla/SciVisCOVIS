# Python Setup

The necessary packages for this project are listed in the file requirements.txt, to make sure you have the right versions run the following:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Description of Codebase

Here we briefly describe relevant files to the project.

## `data`

Contains the data is stored that is used to create the visualisation. This is both the data for the seafloor bathymetry and the imaging data of the hydrothermal plumes. 

## `legacy`

Contains Python Notebooks that have been used for data exploration and the Matlab2Python folder where the Matlab code was used to recreate the original visualisation. 

## `results`

Contains the visualisations made during the project and are used in the final report.
